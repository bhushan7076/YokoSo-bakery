        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          Founded in 2020, Yokoso Bake House began as a passion project bringing authentic Japanese baking techniques to Pune. 
          What started as a small home bakery has grown into a beloved local destination for those seeking light, fluffy cheesecakes 
          and delicate pastries with a Japanese twist.

          Our name "Yokoso" means "welcome" in Japanese - and that's exactly how we want every customer to feel when they visit us.
